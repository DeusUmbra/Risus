  <h2>Welcome to Risus!</h2>
  <p>
    &emsp;You may be asking yourself "What is Risus?" The technical answer is that Risus is a simple setting neutral 
    tabletop role-playing game (or TTRPG) that anyone can pick up and play in a short time, best part is that it is completely
    free! The fun answer is: Anything you want it to be! Basically, you get a group of friends, some six sided dice
    (or better yet, use the dice roller on this app!) and of course some paper and pencils. Then, pick one person to run the game
    while everyone else creates some simple characters using 10 points. You assign points to cliches for the character, anywhere
    from 1 to 4 points per cliche, and these create the stats and abilities for your character. You may be wondering "Cliche?
    What's that?" Let me put it this way; have you ever watched a movie and you knew what kind of character someone was right
    away? Let's say you watched a cop movie and you get introduced to an older serious cop and he gets a new partner, you already
    know where this is going right? Well, those characters are a series of cliches, like "Rookie Cop" or "Alchoholic Detective".
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    &emsp;Once you put together your characters (don't take it too seriously, this is just for fun remember!) and your Game Master
    (The friend running the game) is ready with a world for you (which hopefully you asked about before making a character) you 
    can now start playing the game! It's mostly going to be role-playing, where you pretend to be someone else (your character)
    and tell a story with your friends, but let's say you need to get into a locked room, now you roll those dice! Pick a cliche
    that works for the task (a Shifty Rogue cliche for example) and roll the dice equal to the points you put into the cliche.
    Your game master will tell you if you rolled well enough to open it or not, and that's it! Everything is done like this,
    if you are trying to sneak past someone you roll against each other, if you are in a fight now it gets slightly more complicated.
    Now instead of just rolling once against them, you roll once and whoever loses has to remove a dice from their cliche. You then
    pick what cliche you are using again, say how it is being used, and then roll again, and keep doing this until one person is 
    out of dice to roll on one of their cliches.

    &emsp;This is more or less all you need to know to understand the game, but if you want more info on how to play (for example
    fighting as a team) then just look at the Rules tab to see the full free rulebook! Don't worry, its short, only 4 pages long!
    If that is still not enough for you, or you just want to expand your game further, check out some of our links at the bottom
    that will send you to websites where you can get info from other fans, or even buy expanded rule books or adventures!
